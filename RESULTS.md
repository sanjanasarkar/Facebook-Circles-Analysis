# Whew! It's been an intense few weeks. Here's what we did:
1. Graph Creation

2. Traversals

3. Floyd-Warshall Shortest Path Algorithm <\br>
##### The Time Complexity
Floyd-Warshall is a powerful algorithm, but in the process of completing our project we found that it is also one of the slowest. Floyd-Warshall has a runtime complexity of O(n^3). With the Facebook dataset's 4093 nodes it would take approximately 18 million hours (760,000 days) to run. Hmm.. this algorithm sounds like it sucks BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
##### The Power of This Algorithm
When we applied Floyd-Warshall to smaller subsets of data, it worked like a charm.

4. IDDFS
