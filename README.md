### Instructions:

1. Clone the repository - `git clone https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/pranavg4-bx3-shivenk2-ssarkar8.git`. The datasets are all included in the repo, so no extra downloads are required.
2. Make the executable using `make finalproj` (or `make -j finalproj` to speed up the compilation)
3. Run using `./finalproj` and follow the convenient on-screen instructions!
4. When done, use `make clean` to clean up leftover object files and executables if so desired.

#### Testing (Optional):
To test, first make the executable with `make test` (or `make -j test`) followed by `./test` to run the tests.
